# SublimeFlatColors [![Gittip](http://badgr.co/gittip/jbrooksuk.png)](https://www.gittip.com/jbrooksuk/)
SublimeFlatColors is a plugin for the growing popular editor [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com). It simply lists all Flat UI color names `nephritis, carrot, emerland` etc and expands them to their representing hex codes.

## Compatibility
This plugin is fully compatible with Sublime Text 2 and 3!

## Installation
Easiest way is to install via [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation), just search for "SublimeFlatColors". *Coming Soon*

If you don't have Package Control (which you should do, it's amazing) then you can use Git. Just clone this directory to your Sublime Text `/Packages` directory.

## Usage
Completions will only be displayed when the cursor is under a CSS scope. This is currently static, however I plan on adding a way to add scopes via a configuration file.
